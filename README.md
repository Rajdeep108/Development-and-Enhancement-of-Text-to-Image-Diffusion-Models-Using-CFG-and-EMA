# Development-and-Enhancement-of-Text-to-Image-Diffusion-Models-Using-CFG-and-EMA
This repository contains the code and resources for the dissertation project titled "Development and Enhancement of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using CFG and EMA." The project explores the application of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly focusing on the stable diffusion v1.4 model. This work was conducted as part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence program by Rajdeep Roshan Sahu at Queen Mary University of London.

### Project Overview
This project focuses on the development and enhancement of text-to-image diffusion models using Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The primary objective is to improve the performance and stability of diffusion models, particularly the Stable Diffusion v1.4 model, through the integration of EMA during training.
