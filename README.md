# Development-and-Enhancement-of-Text-to-Image-Diffusion-Models-Using-CFG-and-EMA
This repository contains the code and resources for the dissertation project titled "Development and Enhancement of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using CFG and EMA." The project explores the application of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) techniques to enhance the performance of text-to-image diffusion models, particularly focusing on the stable diffusion v1.4 model. This work was conducted as part of the MSc in Artificial Intelligence program by Rajdeep Roshan Sahu at Queen Mary University of London.
